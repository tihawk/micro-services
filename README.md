# useless Î¼icro-services

This is a small collection of pretty useless web micro-services. They can have a purpose if you find one for them. Apart from that, this is more of a fun project for a custom API. Access them via the navbar on top, or go to API and find out how to access these tools using requests to the API from your website.

TODO:
- [] add the remaining services
- [] add info about using the API
- [] get running online
- [] add CORS
- [] prettify?
- [] run browserfy or smtin
