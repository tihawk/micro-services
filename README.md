# useless Î¼icro-services

not online yet: ~~This is a small collection of pretty useless web micro-services. They can have a purpose if you find one for them. Apart from that, this is more of a fun project for a custom API. Access them via the navbar on top, or go to API and find out how to access these tools using requests to the API from your website.~~

### Contains:

- [x] Timestamp service with input for custom natural language, ISO and unixtime
- [x] Header parser with info for IP, OS and Language
- [ ] URL shortener
- [ ] Image search abstraction layer
- [ ] uploaded file metadata

### TODO:

- [ ] add the remaining services
- [ ] add info about using the API
- [ ] get running online
- [ ] add CORS
- [ ] prettify?
- [ ] run browserfy or smtin

### ~~How to make calls to API:~~ coming soon...
