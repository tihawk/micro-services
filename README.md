# [useless Î¼icro-services](https://ums.glitch.me/)

This is a small collection of pretty useless web micro-services. They can have a purpose if you find one for them. Apart from that, this is more of a fun project for a custom API. Access them via the navbar on top, or go to API and find out how to access these tools using requests to the API from your website.

### Client host

<https://ums.glitch.me/>

### Contains:

- [x] Timestamp service with input for custom natural language, ISO and unixtime
- [x] Header parser with info for IP, OS and Language
- [x] URL shortener

### TODO:

- [ ] add the remaining services
- [ ] add info about using the API
- [x] get running online
